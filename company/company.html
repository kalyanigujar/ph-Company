      In 2018, Phia Lab launched the Bio-Itzá Reserve – Shield the Source Fund, a donor-advised fund
      created in partnership with the Bio-Itzá Association in San José, Guatemala, and The Resource

      The Bio-Itzá Association, established in 1991, is dedicated to conserving the Bio-Itzá Biosphere
      Reserve—a 36 km² community forest reserve and Guatemala’s first Cultural and Ethnobotanical Reserve.
      Nestled beside the El Zotz Biotope and close to the world-renowned Tikal National Park,
      this protected corridor provides a safe haven for rare plant and animal species that are rapidly
      disappearing from the Maya Biosphere Buffer Zone.
    </p>

    <p id="p-bio-2">
      Through its ongoing commitment, the Association leads the Bio-Itzá Ranger Program, which plays a
      vital role in protecting and patrolling the reserve, restoring the base camp and medicinal plant gardens,
      and preserving the Maya Itzá culture. This effort is deeply inspired by the tireless work of Don
      Reginaldo Chayax and his dedicated team, whose passion ensures that both the natural ecosystem and the
      cultural heritage of the region continue to thrive. Travelers, nature enthusiasts, and cultural explorers
      are encouraged to visit the reserve to experience an authentic eco-adventure while supporting conservation
      efforts.

        <p id="p-bio-3">
          In alignment with these goals, Phia Lab is collaborating on the development of a
          sustainable, eco-friendly basecamp within the reserve. Partnering with senior
          engineering students from the Colorado School of Mines, the team has completed a
          community-driven design that integrates eco-cottages for visitors and researchers,
          off-grid renewable energy systems, and innovative water and wastewater management
          solutions. This project reflects a vision of creating a self-sustaining model for forest
          conservation while also promoting long-term economic stability for the community.
        </p>
        <p id="p-bio-4">
          By supporting the Bio-Itzá Association’s mission, we contribute to the protection of
          biodiversity, the safeguarding of endangered species, and the preservation of natural
          energy and wellness resources that sustain us all. Together, we can ensure that the
          Bio-Itzá Reserve remains a thriving sanctuary for generations to come.
